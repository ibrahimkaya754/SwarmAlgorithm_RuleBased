    "# Swarm Algorithm for Objects Moving in 2D Domain\n",

    "The code below shows swarming particles (like drones) in 2 Dimensional domain and has been generated with rule based algorithm given in the great paper \"Outdoor flocking and formation flight with autonomous aerial robots\" by Vicsek et. al. [1] The document referenced in [2] is also a very explanatory and beneficial to understand the basics of swarm concept.\n",
